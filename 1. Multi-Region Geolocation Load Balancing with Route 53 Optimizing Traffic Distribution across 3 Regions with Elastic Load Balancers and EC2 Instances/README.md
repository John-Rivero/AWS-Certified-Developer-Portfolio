## Created by: John Rivero

## Date: April 6, 2023


## Task

- Set up AWS Infrastructure with Route 53 Geolocation for three regions (us-east-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1), and configure three elastic load balancers with two EC2 instances each, connected with Route 53 for inter-regional load balancing.


## Step 1

- Design an infrastructure diagram illustrating the configuration of Route 53 Geolocation for three distinct regions. Each region should include one Elastic Load Balancer and two EC2 instances.
