## [1. Multi-Region Geolocation Load Balancing with Route 53: Optimizing Traffic Distribution across 3 Regions with Elastic Load Balancers and EC2 Instances](https://github.com/John-Rivero/AWS-Cloud-Engineer-Portfolio/tree/main/1.%20Multi-Region%20Geolocation%20Load%20Balancing%20with%20Route%2053%20Optimizing%20Traffic%20Distribution%20across%203%20Regions%20with%20Elastic%20Load%20Balancers%20and%20EC2%20Instances)


- This project involves setting up an AWS Infrastructure with Route 53 Geolocation configured for three distinct regions, namely us-east-1, eu-central-1, and ap-southeast-1.

- In addition, this project employs three separate elastic load balancers, each with two EC2 instances, across the three regions, which are all interconnected with Route 53.
